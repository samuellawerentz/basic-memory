# SessionStart hook — brief Claude from Basic Memory at the start of a session.
#
# This is the read side of the memory bridge: it puts the most relevant slice of
# the durable knowledge graph in front of Claude before the first prompt, so the
# session starts oriented instead of cold.
#
# Reads (all structured, all best-effort):
#   - the primary project's active tasks + open decisions
#   - open decisions from each configured shared/team project (secondaryProjects +
#     teamProjects), queried in parallel — this is the Phase 4 "recall reads across
#     the team" capability. Reads only; capture never touches a shared project.
#
# Contract: advisory, must NEVER disrupt a session. Every failure path exits 0 with
# no output. SessionStart adds plain stdout to Claude's context (verified — Q4),
# capped at 10,000 chars, so the brief stays small and bounded.

# persistent CLI installed — the uv cache is already warm from running the server.
# Trigger: none of basic-memory / bm / uvx / uv on PATH → BM isn't usable here.
# Outcome: silent no-op (the plugin must be invisible to non-BM users).
